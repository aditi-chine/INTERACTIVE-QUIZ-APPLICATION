#Descripation of the Task

The Interactive Quiz Application is a lightweight web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple and dynamic interface where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive a score at the end. The application loads questions dynamically from a predefined dataset and keeps track of the current question index and user score.

The structure of the project includes three main files. The HTML file (index.html) provides the structure of the application and links to the external CSS and JavaScript files. It includes placeholders for the quiz content, such as the question, options, and the score display, which are updated dynamically during runtime. The CSS file (style.css) styles the application with a clean, responsive design and interactive hover effects on buttons. Finally, the JavaScript file (script.js) implements the core functionality, such as dynamically loading questions, validating user answers, navigating through questions, and calculating the final score.

The quiz data is stored in an array of objects, each containing a question, answer options, and the correct answer index. Functions like loadQuestion() and handleAnswer() dynamically update the content and handle user interactions. The application ends by displaying the user's total score after all questions are answered. This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners and can be enhanced with features like timers, additional question types, or animations. It is self-contained and does not rely on external libraries, ensuring simplicity and ease of use
